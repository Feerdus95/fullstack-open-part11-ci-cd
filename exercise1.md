# CI/CD for Our Go Backend 🚀

So, after building full-stack apps with React and Node.js, diving into a Go backend feels like a fresh challenge. Our hipothetical team of 6 is cooking, so we need a solid CI pipeline.

## Tooling Up

Coming from the JavaScript world, Go's ecosystem is both familiar and different. For linting, `golangci-lint` is basically our ESLint equivalent - it keeps our code clean and catches potential issues before they become problems. 

Testing is where Go really shines. `go test` is straightforward, kinda like Jest, but with less configuration drama. We can easily set up unit and integration tests, and the built-in testing framework is pretty intuitive.

## CI Platforms - More Than Just GitHub Actions

Sure, GitHub Actions is great (and we've used it before), but we're exploring options:
- CircleCI looks slick and has nice Docker integration
- GitLab CI feels familiar from previous projects
- Drone CI is quite interesting - super lightweight and container-native

## The Hosting Dilemma

Self-hosted or cloud? Not a simple choice. Coming from our previous projects, we know infrastructure matters. We'll need to dig into:
- Security requirements (no more exposing env files like in the early days! 😅)
- Computational needs
- Budget constraints
- Compliance stuff (GDPR nightmares, anyone?)

The real decision depends on specifics we don't fully know yet. Classic software development, right? Always more questions than answers.

Pro tip: Whatever we choose, we're definitely containerizing this bad boy. Docker is our friend.
